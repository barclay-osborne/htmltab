CHANGES IN htmltab VERSION 0.5.0

NEW FEATURES

o Header and body are now treated as complementary elements of a table, i.e. passing (numeric) information about the position of either of the two will be used for the identification of the other.
o Added a new argument (fillNA) to replace non-data cells cells by NA
o Added a new argument (rm_nodata_cols) to remove columns that have no apparent data value
o Added a new argument (rm_invisible) to remove invisible nodes from the table node

BUG FIXES

o Fixed a problem where htmltable failed when a table didn't nest a row within tr tags. Now every table is controlled, and tr tags are added when necessary
o Fixed a small problem with misspecified spans in the table header
o Added meaningful error message when table couldn't be identified
o Fixed problem where a header warning was thrown even when colNames was supplied

MAJOR CHANGES

o Revised code for header and body identification. When an XPath is passed to either of the two, it must treat the parent table node as the root. This change is backward incompatible.
