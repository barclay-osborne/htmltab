Package: htmltable
Title: Assemble data frames from HTML tables
Version: 0.4
Authors@R: "Christian Rubba <christian.rubba@gmail.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: htmltable is a package for extracting structured information from
    HTML tables. It is similiar to XML's readHTMLTable() but provides two major
    advantages. First, the package automatically expands row- and columnspans
    in the header and body cells. Users are also given more control over the
    specification of header and body rows. Second, the package gives users more
    control over which and how information from the HTML table end up in the R
    table. It sets sensible default value to alleviate the problem of tedious
    post-processing.

    R (>= 3.1.0)
